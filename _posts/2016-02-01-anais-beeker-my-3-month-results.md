I used to think of working out as a chore. If I couldn't fit it in, it fell to the wayside and so I became complacent with myself. Sure, I was a gym member at other places and there was a gym 50 yards away in my apartment complex. But I had no urgency to change and craft my mind and body into what it is today.  

I had always noticed the Maryville Boxing Club, but I will be honest in that I was slighted intimidated. I'm not athletic by any means let alone know the first thing about boxing. So when Maryville Boxing Club reached out using Facebook and its gym members to have a "Bring a Friend" day I was highly interested. I decided to go with a buddy, and I've been hooked ever since my first workout on January 8th, 2015\. Not only is it a stress relief to go and release those endorphins in the high intensity workouts and learn about nutrition, but my gym as a whole is amazing. 

The owners, Chad and Mia Mueller, know their members by name and strive to construct new and exciting workouts and programs every week. They are innovative, encouraging, and emphatic trainers who change people as a whole and always take the time to work one-on-one when needed.

Spiritually, physically, and emotionally, I feel as though my workouts aren't just something I can put aside anymore. They are something that I owe to myself and they are an integral part of my lifestyle now. When I first started going to the gym, I sometimes would groan, under my breath, when Chad would say, "I have a new game for us to play today," or "I just researched this new workout." In the end, the challenges and creativity paid off. My body and mind are not what they were 6 months ago and I have Maryville Boxing Club to thank.
