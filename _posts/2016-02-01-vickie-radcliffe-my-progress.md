I was very skeptical when one of my friends suggested a group of us girls try this free for one week.  I had been walking for a while but then my dad passed away and I had let myself go.  I figured it would be something fun to do for a week with my friends, so I went.  It was Thursday, January 2nd, 2013 and when I got home, My husband asked me "how was it"?  I told him I was never going back.  Well, that next Monday I went back to class and felt a little better after I left and on Wednesday I signed a 6 month contract.  I started to lose weight, feel better about myself, and feel healthier.  After my 1st 6 months was up I signed for a year.   I have lost and maintained a 35\# weight loss for over 2 years, feels stronger, healthier, and better than I ever have.  I love this gym because everyone is in the same boat and there for the same reason-to get healthy, fit, learn.  In all the time I have been going I have never felt judged and have had amazing encouragement from everyone there especially Chad and Mia.  I have had a hip problem for a while and Mia has given me some advice on strength and stretching ideas and Chad has modified some of the work outs so I can continue to work out but not be in pain.  
I recommend this gym to anyone that I come in contact with that asks about my journey and to anyone who wants to start their own.
